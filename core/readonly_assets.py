"""readonly_assets — per-movie asset writers for readonly gallery sources
(TASK-151a-T2).

Pure backend module. NO API, NO UI, NO frontend.

Split out of core/readonly_producer.py (TASK-151a-T2): the 10 functions below
decide "how does a readonly source's NFO/cover/poster/fanart/.strm/sample
images land on disk, and how is the previous run's stale output cleaned up" —
stale-asset cleanup, the .strm playback-path mapping/write, curator sidecar
ingest copies, cover/poster/fanart writes, sample-image downloads, and the
top-level _write_movie_assets orchestrator. Zero behaviour change versus
their previous home; depends on core.readonly_paths (TASK-151a-T1) for
basename construction.

def _apply_path_mapping(source_fs_path: str, mappings: dict) -> str:
    """Rewrite a source FS-path prefix to the playback-side namespace.

    strm files are consumed by an external media server (Emby/Jellyfin/Kodi) that
    may see the same physical storage under a DIFFERENT mount path than OpenAver's
    host (e.g. OpenAver on Windows sees ``Z:\\115\\x.mp4`` while the media server
    on the NAS sees ``/volume1/movie/x.mp4``). mappings maps ``local_prefix ->
    remote_prefix``; the matched prefix is swapped and the remainder appended.

    Matching is done in ``file:///`` URI space: both source and each local_prefix
    are converged via ``to_file_uri`` (host-independent, never raises, no
    percent-encoding in this codebase). This fixes two Codex findings:

    - P1 (cross-namespace silent miss): a Windows-display prefix ``C:\\115`` in
      config now matches a WSL-native source ``/mnt/c/115/x.mp4`` (both converge
      to ``file:///C:/115``). Raw-string compare would have silently missed and
      emitted the un-mapped source path.
    - P2 (trailing separator): a local_prefix with a trailing separator
      (``/mnt/z/115/``) no longer misses — the URI form is rstrip'd of ``/``.

    A rule matches when the source URI equals the (trailing-slash-stripped) local
    URI OR the char immediately after it is ``/`` (URIs always use forward-slash,
    so no OS branch). This stops ``file:///Z:/1150/a`` from wrongly matching a
    ``file:///Z:/115`` rule. When several rules match, the LONGEST local URI wins
    (deterministic, independent of dict insertion order). Empty mappings or no
    match returns source_fs_path unchanged (v1 backward compat).

    CD-90a-6: only source/local_prefix are converged (for MATCHING). The remote
    result is written VERBATIM and is NEVER normalized — it is a foreign playback
    namespace (a bare Unix ``/volume1/...`` fed to to_windows_path on a Windows
    host raises). We only rstrip trailing separators off remote_prefix for join

    the disconnect-tail residual: the SSE watcher clears the generate token the instant it
    detects a disconnect, but the producer thread only checks should_abort at each per-file

    frozen mapping and never self-heal. A fresh read makes even that last file use the current
    mapping. None preserves the legacy read (rewrite_strm + unit tests pass config verbatim).

    VERBATIM. The single preflight-owning choke point for that copy — both
    slots in ``_write_media_images`` go through here, neither calls
    ``shutil.copy2`` on a sidecar itself.

    Tri-state return (there are genuinely three outcomes, and collapsing any
    two of them is what produced the bug below):

    | 回傳 | 意思 | 呼叫端 |
    |---|---|---|

    | ``False`` | 同一檔但無法確認（未知 ``OSError``）| 記 has_*=False，**不 generate**（fail-closed）|
    | ``None``  | 沒複製成功、也沒有 curator 原檔會被蓋掉 | **落回 generate 分支** |

    Codex PR#125 round-2 P1 (2026-08-05) — why the preflight is here at all:
    when the readonly source's output root resolves back onto the source movie
    directory AND the basename lands on the source stem, ``src`` and ``dst``
    are the SAME file (the curator's own sidecar IS the output slot). The old
    code copied first and asked later: ``shutil.copy2`` raised
    ``SameFileError``, the broad ``except`` swallowed it into "copy failed",
    and the slot fell through to the generate branch — whose own
    ``same_target_verdict`` preflight compares ``cover_fs`` vs ``dst``, a
    DIFFERENT pair that is legitimately "not the same file". So
    ``crop_to_poster(cover_fs, poster_path)`` cropped the machine cover
    straight over the curator's hand-picked portrait poster (reproduced:
    379×538 blue → a crop of the 800×538 red cover, md5 changed). OpenAver's
    own UI cannot show this — ``find_cover_image``'s L1.5 prefers ``-fanart``
    — so the damage lands entirely on the Jellyfin/Emby/Kodi side, i.e. the
    exact surface AC5's curator boundary ("**逐位元組保留 curator 原檔**") and
    prd.md 技術決策 #6 ("衍生產物不回寫原檔") exist to protect. It is also a
    REGRESSION of this branch, not a pre-existing bug: before ``_write_cover_copy``
    learned the same-target case (commit 2338c62d/a552f674) the cover step
    itself returned ``has_cover=False`` here and ``_write_media_images`` was
    never reached.

    Why the sidecar copy needs the preflight and not just a ``SameFileError``
    catch: ``shutil.copyfile``'s internal ``_samefile`` swallows ``OSError``
    and returns ``False``, so on a filesystem where ``os.path.samefile`` raises
    (permission denied / some network shares — the case ``same_target_verdict``
    was built for) ``copy2`` proceeds to open the destination ``'wb'`` and
    truncates the very file it is reading from. That is the identical
    corruption CD-112-8 already fenced off at the six ``cover → dst`` write
    sites; the sidecar copies are ``sidecar → dst`` and were therefore
    invisible to that inventory's own ``copy2(cover, *)`` grep (see
    ``core.cover_layout``'s 交棒清單, rows ⑨/⑩).

    ``is_same and certain`` still re-confirms ``dst`` on disk for the same
    reason ``_write_cover_copy`` does (Codex PR#125 round-1 P2): the
    ``src == dst`` cell of ``same_target_verdict`` answers by string comparison
    with zero I/O, and ``src`` here comes from ``resolve_ingest_plan``'s
    ``.exists()`` several I/O hops away. A sidecar that vanished in between is
    NOT a passthrough to report as success — but there is also no curator file
    left to clobber, so that case returns ``None`` (regenerate) rather than
    ``False``.

    Pre-existing bug found by red-team during 112b pre-merge (2026-08-04):
    when the readonly source's output root sits inside the source tree AND
    ``movie_dir``/``base`` land back on the source directory/stem, ``src``
    and ``dst`` (``resolve_cover_target``'s canonical position) can be the
    SAME file. This was already reachable pre-112; CD-112-7 (curator
    ``-fanart`` promoted to cover source when no same-stem cover exists)
    opened a second path into it. Bare ``shutil.copyfile`` raises
    ``SameFileError`` (an ``OSError`` subclass) in that case, which the old
    bare ``except OSError:`` swallowed into ``has_cover=False`` — skipping
    ALL of poster/fanart generation and writing an empty DB ``cover_path``
    even though the cover is sitting right there on disk, intact (violates
    AC5b). Same ``same_target_verdict`` preflight shape as
    ``generate_jellyfin_images`` (CD-112b-1): ``certain`` — not a bare
    ``True`` — drives the return value (CD-112-8 safety/honesty split);
    ``SameFileError`` is a race backstop for "still-distinct-at-preflight,
    same-by-copy-time" and MUST stay ahead of ``except OSError`` since it
    subclasses it.

    Codex PR#125 P2 (2026-08-05): the ``is_same`` branch additionally requires
    ``dst`` to still be on disk. ``same_target_verdict``'s ``src == dst`` cell
    answers by string comparison alone with zero I/O — it is the ONE cell of the
    five that can return ``(True, True)`` for a path that does not exist (its own
    docstring names this residual and says it "**必須重新評估**" once T3 makes
    string equality the readonly hot path — this is that re-evaluation). The
    other six ``same_target_verdict`` call sites re-confirm ``dst`` a few lines
    earlier; this one does not — ``src`` comes from ``cover_strategy[1]``, whose
    ``.exists()`` check happened back in ``resolve_ingest_plan`` several I/O hops
    away, so an external delete in between lands here as a **false success**:

    full mode (default) returns {'cover_fs': str, 'sample_fs': list[str],
    'nfo_mtime': float}. cover_fs is '' when the cover step produces no file (see
    cover_strategy below). nfo_mtime (TASK-104-T1 / CD-104-4) is the real
    os.stat().st_mtime of the NFO just written — generate_nfo has already raised
    on failure by the time this is read, so the file is guaranteed to exist.

    Codex PR#113 round-3 (2026-07-21) added a `write_nfo` gate here that let a
    readonly produce skip the NFO write. REVERTED (owner-confirmed, round-3
    review): that gate was a P1 data-loss — a title-changing rescrape with
    write_nfo=False would skip writing `<new_base>.nfo` while
    `_clean_stale_singletons` still unlinked the OLD `<old_base>.nfo`, losing
    the NFO entirely while the DB kept a stale nfo_mtime claiming it exists.
    Readonly produce is a HOLISTIC operation (a library entry always has an
    NFO) — the router now rejects write_nfo=false for readonly up front (see
    `_READONLY_NO_NFO_ERROR_MSG` in web/routers/scraper.py) instead of
    threading a skip flag down here. The NFO is therefore always written,
    unconditionally, exactly like every other produce caller.

    samples_only mode (TASK-104-T1 / CD-104-1) returns ONLY {'sample_fs':
    list[str]} — downloads meta['sample_images'] into movie_dir/extrafanart
    UNCONDITIONALLY (NOT gated on config['download_sample_images']: an explicit
    supplemental-fetch call means "yes, get samples") and touches NOTHING else —
    no nfo/cover/poster/fanart/strm, no _clean_stale_extrafanart, no
    _clean_stale_singletons. Keeps a "fetch more samples" action from ever
    clobbering metadata/cover it wasn't asked to touch (Codex P1-c).

    cover_strategy (TASK-104-T1 / CD-104-2) replaces the old binary
    "None=download" rule with an explicit 3-state tuple:
      ('copy', local_fs_path) — copy a LOCAL file already on disk into cover_fs
        (ingest, T2: zero network). Copy failure (missing/unreadable source) →
        has_cover=False, same graceful-failure semantics as a failed download —
        never raises.
      ('none',) — do not write a cover at all (ingest has a .nfo but no cover
        image; must NOT silently fall back to downloading).
      ('download', remote_url) — has_cover = bool(remote_url) and
        download_image(remote_url, cover_fs); byte-identical to the pre-T1
        unconditional-download branch (scrape / gear rescrape, C6).
    poster/fanart: generate_jellyfin_images(...) runs whenever has_cover is
    True AND external_manager in STEM_IMAGE_MODES (CD-111-2) AND cover_strategy
    carries no 3rd element (scrape/rescrape, or ingest with no detected curator
    sidecars). When cover_strategy is the 3-tuple ingest-copy form (see
    resolve_ingest_plan docstring), each detected `{stem}-poster`/`{stem}-fanart`
    sidecar is copied VERBATIM into the output slot instead of being regenerated
    from the cover; a slot with no detected sidecar still falls back to the
    generate step. See `_write_media_images` below.

    old_base (TASK-89a-T4, Codex #3; T5 follow-up, Codex PR review P2): when
    non-empty, this movie's own stale assets from the PREVIOUS run (different
    title → different basename) are deleted — but only AFTER the corresponding
    new asset has been written successfully, and only when old_base differs
    from this run's basename. The singleton assets (nfo/cover/poster/fanart)
    are cleaned only once generate_nfo has already succeeded, and only the
    ones whose new write actually succeeded this run — so a write that fails
    partway (cover download false, generate_nfo raising) leaves the previous
    run's assets on disk instead of deleting them up front and then failing
    to produce replacements. (samples_only never reaches this cleanup — see
    above.)

    Extrafanart is now managed EXCLUSIVELY by the samples_only (補劇照) path
    (P1 grok-review, pre-merge 2026-07-21): full mode only cleans+rewrites the
    extrafanart dir when THIS run itself carries new sample_images to write
    (``old_base and meta.get('sample_images')``) — full-mode ingest/rescrape
    callers always pass ``meta['sample_images'] == []`` (CD-104-3), so on a
    FULL-mode re-entry of an already-produced video (gear rescrape / 放大鏡
    ingest / batch-enrich) this branch is skipped and previously-fetched
    samples on disk survive untouched. A bare ``if old_base:`` would delete
    the extrafanart dir on every full-mode re-entry even though full mode
    never repopulates it, silently wiping 補劇照 output for any video that
    gets re-produced. Any hypothetical future caller that DOES pass full-mode
    samples still gets correct clean+rewrite semantics.

    user_tags (TASK-143-T5, CD-143-5): forwarded verbatim to generate_nfo so a
    rescrape REGENERATES <user_tag> instead of dropping it (the DB row keeps them
    either way — what was lost is the copy a media server reads). _produce_one
    must read them BEFORE _upsert_db overwrites the row. None → [] → byte-identical
    to pre-T5, which is why the ~40 direct test call sites need no change.

    """從錨點檔案路徑解析「片級 stem」與「錨點屬於哪個 slot」（Codex PR#197
    review P2，151b pre-merge 後的新洞）：`cover_base_stem()` 純字串剝一次
    `-poster`/`-fanart` 尾碼，分不出「衍生的 sidecar 尾碼」與「尾碼本來就是
    基底標題的一部分」——例如基底真的叫 `Movie-fanart`、旁邊還有衍生的
    `Movie-fanart-poster.jpg` / `Movie-fanart-fanart.jpg`：naive 剝法會把
    `Movie-fanart.jpg` 誤剝成 `Movie`，讓兩個真正的 sidecar 在被誤剝的 stem
    底下遍尋不著、永遠孤兒留在舊基底，而錯的 sidecar（若恰好存在）被誤當
    成錨點搬進錯的 slot。`_rename_stale_cover_group` 是把這個二義性變成
    實際搬檔案＋DB CAS＋NFO 寫入的第一個呼叫端——**分不出來就不要動**，
    這是本函式存在的唯一理由。

    純函式、唯讀：只呼叫 `os.path.splitext` / `os.path.join` /
    `os.scandir`，**不搬檔、不寫任何東西**。**不呼叫 `cover_base_stem()`
    ——本函式就是要取代那個判斷**，兩者並存會製造第二份可能漂移的推導。

    **第五輪 review 效能修正：證據判定一次性列舉目錄，不逐檔 `os.path.exists`**
    ——舊版對兩套候選各探 `-poster`／`-fanart` × `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`（6 個），
    最多 24 次 `os.path.exists`；`movie_dir` 是單片資料夾、檔案數量有限，
    `os.scandir(movie_dir)` 一次取得全部檔名，剩下全部是記憶體字串比對。
    這支函式是 `produce_source` 掃全庫的熱路徑——本機是微秒級無感，但在
    NAS／SMB 掛載下每次 `stat`（`os.path.exists` 底層）都是一趟網路來回，
    6000 部片規模會是十幾萬次。詳見 `_list_dir_names_normcased` 的實作。

    回傳 `(old_stem_abs, anchor_stem_suffix)`；`anchor_stem_suffix` 是
    `''`／`'-poster'`／`'-fanart'` 之一，對應 `old_cover_fs` 落在哪個 slot。
    **無法判定回 `None`**——呼叫端必須整組 no-op，不得猜。

    演算法：
    1. **`literal`**：`os.path.splitext(old_cover_fs)[0]`，視為 `''` slot。
    2. **`stripped`**：**只有** `literal` 以 `-poster`／`-fanart` 結尾才成立，
       剝掉該尾碼、視為對應的 sidecar slot。`literal` 不以那兩者結尾時
       只有一套候選，**直接採用 `literal`、立即返回、零磁碟 I/O（連
       `os.scandir` 都不呼叫）、也不看 `old_base_hint`**，不進下面的選擇
       規則——這是絕大多數呼叫（無 `-poster`/`-fanart` 尾碼疑慮的正常片）
       的路徑，效能不能被下面的證據蒐集拖慢。
    3. 選擇規則，依序（**磁碟證據優先於提示**，見下方⚠️為什麼）：
       a. **列一次目錄取證**（不論有沒有給提示都先算）：`_list_dir_names_
          normcased` 回傳 `None` ⇒ **掃描失敗**（目錄不在／被刪除／權限被
          拒／NAS 暫時性失敗，皆為 `OSError` 子類）——**不知道**目錄裡有
          什麼，不是「沒有證據」，**立刻整組回 `None`，跳過下面 b/c/d
          全部**，不准讓 `old_base_hint` 裁決（Codex 第五輪 review P2，
          修正第九輪把「掃描失敗」與「掃描成功但空」錯誤壓成同一個狀態的
          洞）。掃描成功（回傳一個 `frozenset`，可能是空的）才繼續：目錄裡
          有 `{literal_basename}-poster{ext}` 或 `{literal_basename}-fanart{ext}`
          ⇒ 支持 `literal`；目錄裡有 `{stripped_basename}{ext}`（同名封面）
          或 `{stripped_basename}{other_suffix}{ext}`（另一個 sidecar）
          ⇒ 支持 `stripped`。副檔名逐一試 `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`，**仍然禁止
          glob**（現在是字串比對，本來就用不到）；比對前雙邊都過
          `os.path.normcase`（Windows 大小寫不敏感，維持既有語意）。
       b. **恰好一套有證據 → 採它，即使 `old_base_hint` 指向另一套**——
          證據裁決，提示不得覆蓋。
       c. **兩套都有證據 → 回 `None`**（歧義；提示不得裁決哪一套對）。
       d. **掃描成功、兩套都沒有證據 → `old_base_hint` 才准補位**：
          `os.path.join(movie_dir, old_base_hint)` 精確匹配某個候選的
          stem 就採它；不匹配（或未給提示）⇒ 回 `None`。這是 off 單封面
          （零 sibling 可證）那類佈局唯一能消歧的手段。

    ⚠️ **為什麼提示不能優先於磁碟證據（Codex 第四輪 review P2，修正上一輪
    的錯誤推理）**：上一版本這裡寫的是「提示精確匹配某候選就代表 `old_base`
    尚未失憶」——**這個推理是錯的**。精確匹配只證明兩個字串相等，不證明
    `old_base` 本身仍是權威值。反例：舊基底真的叫 `Movie-fanart`（plain
    `Movie-fanart.jpg` ＋ nested `-poster`／`-fanart` 兩個真 sidecar），
    使用者把標題改成 `Movie`，**上一輪已經把 DB title 更新成 `Movie`**、
    但圖還沒跟上（例如上一輪 `_write_movie_assets` 失敗後只有 DB 收斂，
    圖的改名沒有；或任何其他讓 DB 先行一步的時序）。這一輪 `old_base_hint`
    == `"Movie"`，**恰好精確匹配 `stripped` 候選的 stem**——但這不是因為
    `old_base` 是本輪的權威值，是因為它**已經失憶成新標題本身**、而新標題
    剛好又跟 `stripped` 候選字面相同（`Movie-fanart` 剝掉 `-fanart` 也是
    `Movie`）。若提示在此優先於證據，會選錯 `stripped`，兩個真正的 nested
    sidecar 永遠留在舊基底孤兒（`old_stem_abs == new_stem_abs` 觸發 C-10
    no-op，函式甚至不會嘗試搬移）。**磁碟證據不會說謊**（`literal` 旁真的
    躺著兩個 nested sidecar），因此證據必須優先；提示只在磁碟上完全沒有
    任何一套的佐證時，才允許補位猜一個答案——這仍然不違反 D-151b-9（見
    `_rename_stale_cover_group` docstring 的說明：錨點的權威來源永遠是
    `existing.cover_path`，`old_base` 從頭到尾只是輔助信號，不曾是唯一

    # 停損規則觸發：`prefer` 那條縫連三輪各補掉上一輪的洞、又開一個新的——見

    #
    # 核心洞見：錨點那一個 slot 要搬的檔案，我們**已經知道**——就是 `old_cover_fs`
    # 本身，函式開頭的 `os.path.exists(old_cover_fs)` 已經驗過它存在。它完全不需要
    # 被 `_resolve_slot` 的 `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS` 列舉「找出來」，用列舉去找一個已知
    # 答案，正是前三輪各種洞的共同根：
    #   ① 原始版：`new_cover_fs = new_stem_abs + old_suffix` 與 `group` 的實際搬移
    #     結果脫鉤——若 `_resolve_slot` 選到的候選副檔名跟 `old_suffix` 不同，回傳
    #     的 URI 指向一個從未被搬到的路徑。
    #   ② 修法一：改用 `group` 裡錨點 slot 實際選中的 `dst`——但 `_resolve_slot`
    #     不知道哪個候選才是 DB 真正指的那個，同 slot 多副檔名時可能選到 sibling，
    #     DB 換指到另一張圖的內容。
    #   ③ 修法二（`prefer` 參數）：只在 `len(hits) > 1` 時才生效——
    #     (a) 錨點副檔名不在 `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`（如 `.tiff`）且同 slot 無其他候選時，
    #         `hits == []`，`prefer` 派不上用場，slot 整個沒進 `group`，`anchor_dst`
    #         留 `None`，最終 `to_file_uri(None, ...)` 崩潰、已搬的其餘 slot 不復原。
    #     (b) 更隱蔽：錨點副檔名不在白名單、但同 slot 恰有一個白名單 sibling時，
    #         `hits` 長度剛好是 1（只有 sibling 命中，錨點本身的副檔名根本不在
    #         `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS` 迴圈裡，永遠不會被列進 `hits`），`len(hits) > 1`
    #         為假，`prefer` 分支完全不會被檢查——直接回傳 `hits[0]`（sibling），
    #         真正的錨點檔案被整個忽略、永遠留在舊基底孤兒，DB 卻悄悄換指到 sibling
    #         的內容。這格窮舉盤點才第一次抓到，比 ③(a) 的崩潰更隱蔽（沒有任何
    #         例外、沒有任何 warning，看起來完全正常）。
    #
    # 新設計：錨點 slot 直接、無條件用 `(old_cover_fs, new_stem_abs + old_suffix)`
    # 這一組 pair——不經過 `_resolve_slot`，因此也不受 `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS` 白名單
    # 限制、不受同 slot sibling 干擾。`anchor_dst` 因此是一個常數運算式，永遠非
    # `None`，永遠等於實際搬移的目的地。`_resolve_slot` 縮回只服務另外兩個非錨點
    # slot 的單純形狀，`prefer` 參數整個消失——減碼優於加碼。
    #
    # sibling 處理：不論錨點副檔名在不在白名單，同一 slot 若還有其他副檔名的檔案，
    # 一律不搬、留在舊基底原地——這不再是「多個候選選一個」的判斷，是「錨點 slot
    # 根本不看候選列表」的必然結果，因此也不再需要單獨的「同一 slot 多個副檔名」
