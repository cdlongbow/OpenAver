"""nfo_read.py — shared, stateless NFO tag-extraction primitives (CD-113a-2).

Six pure functions that collapse the "fallback chain / any-depth / merge-
dedup" resilience rules that used to be hand-written three times independently
in `core.enricher._nfo_to_meta`, `core.gallery_scanner.VideoScanner.parse_nfo`,
and `core.readonly_producer._nfo_to_producer_meta` (spec-113 §2.5 / F-1) into
a single owner. Each function takes an already-parsed `xml.etree.ElementTree`
`<movie>` root and returns a plain Python value — this module knows nothing
about `VideoInfo`, producer-meta, or enricher-meta output shapes (CD-113a-1);
shaping/joining/post-processing stays in each caller.

Declared coupling (§1.4, NOT part of this task's replacement scope):
`core.nfo_updater.add_actor`
(`core/nfo_updater.py:199-209`) independently relies on the same "any-depth
`.//actor/name`" rule to do its pre-write duplicate check. It does NOT call
`nfo_actor_names` here (different responsibility — write-time dedup vs.
read-time extraction) but if the any-depth rule in `nfo_actor_names` ever
changes, `add_actor` must be reviewed for drift.

Companion module: `core.nfo_stat` (F-5, filesystem `.nfo` mtime) is named
symmetrically but deliberately not merged — orthogonal failure domains
(`ET.ParseError` here vs. `OSError` there).

    helper duplicated (byte-identical apart from quote style) in

    CD-113a-7 known limitation (deliberately kept, not a bug): `Element.text`
    only holds the text between the opening tag and its FIRST child element.
    A value wrapped in a nested child — e.g. `<studio><name>X</name></studio>`
    — has `.text is None` and this function returns `''`, silently missing
    `X` (see `BE-SCRAPER-05`). This matches the pre-existing behavior of all

    pinned by `tests/unit/test_nfo_read.py`.
